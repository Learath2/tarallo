# T.A.R.A.L.L.O.

[![Continous Integration](https://github.com/WEEE-Open/tarallo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/WEEE-Open/tarallo/actions/workflows/continous-integration.yml)

Tuttofare Assistente il Riuso di Aggeggi Logori e Localmente Opprimenti  
(aka L'inventario Opportuno)

An extremely granular inventory management software for computer hardware specifically, halfway between a CMDB (configuration management database) and a PIM (product information management).

## Installation

### Environment configuration

First things first, install `docker` (usually `docker.io` in package managers) and `docker-compose` (same name).  
If you have macOS or Windows go [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Then, clone the repository and create a default configuration:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone git@github.com:WEEE-Open/tarallo.git
$ cd tarallo

# Create default configuration
$ cp sample.env .env
```

To configure the development environment, edit the `.env` file in the root directory. the following configuration options (and relative default values) are as follows:

```bash
# Enable XDebug in the development environment
XDEBUG=true

# Enable XDebug's profiler
PROFILER=false

# Wether this is a development or production build
DEVELOPMENT=true
```

### Environment build

The following commands might be used to interact with the development environment:

> NOTE: If you don't have access to the `make` command, open the `Makefile` and execute the commands manually. There are at most a couple of commands for each target. If you're on Windows, you can use `docker_up.bat` to bring up the server.

- `make build` - create the development environment (with caching)
- `make rebuild` - shortcut for `make down destroy build up`
- `make refresh` - create the development environment (without caching)
- `make destroy` - clean up the development environment
- `make up` - start the development environment
- `make down` - stop the development environment
- `make dbupdate` - update the database schema (when instructed to)
- `make examples` - resets database content with example items and products
- `make ci` - used internally by CI: make build without the examples step

Now go to http://localhost:8080 and eat some taralli üç© (this is the most similar emoji, don't judge me, okay?)

### Features

- T.A.R.A.L.L.O. development instance accessible at [`127.0.0.1:8080`](http://127.0.0.1:8080).
- T.A.R.A.L.L.O. APIs at `127.0.0.1:8080/v2/`
- A default user (`dev.user`) generated on the fly with automatic login enabled (you can't test the SSO component, sorry).
- A default API Token: `yoLeCHmEhNNseN0BlG0s3A:ksfPYziGg7ebj0goT0Zc7pbmQEIYvZpRTIkwuscAM_k` (see the [documentation](https://github.com/WEEE-Open/tarallo/wiki/Managing-the-session-and-Authentication)).
- Adminer at [`127.0.0.1:8081`](http://127.0.0.1:8081).
- Database (MariaDB) acessible externally by `root/root` at `127.0.0.1:3307` (note the non-standard port)

If you only have to test out the application or interact with it, you're done!

#### Issues
- Adminer is half broken: you have to _purposefully_ fail the login at least once before logging in for the first time after a `make build` or `make rebuild`

### Development

To connect PHPStorm to XDebug on the docker container, follow these [instructions](docs/xdebug/XDEBUG.md).
Also connect PHPStorm to the database on `127.0.0.1:3307` for maximum efficiency (note the non-standard port).

If you want to profile the application enable the profiler in the [configuration](#environment-configuration). XDebug profiler traces are generated directly within the `utils/xdebug` directory in the git tree on the host machine.

The directories of the git tree that contain the application's sources (`public`, `src` and `tests`) are directly mapped within the container, and changing any file in those directories will immediately reflect on the running instance inside the container.

#### Tests

To run tests from a terminal: `composer test`. Check `composer.json` for the actual command, if you have problems running composer.

To run tests from PHPStorm, follow these [instructions](docs/tests/TESTS.md).

Run with Coverage too, if you want.

#### Linting

To lint your code: `composer lint`. Check `composer.json` for the actual command, if you have problems running composer.

Some errors can be fixed automatically: for that, use `composer lintfix`.

The linter is PHP_CodeSniffer **with a custom configuration**: if you enable PHPStorm integration (which it will propose automatically), you need to specify `Custom` as the Coding Standard:

![alt](docs/lint/images/1.png)

then use the `...` icon and select the full path, on your machine, to the `phpcs.xml` file. If it complains about path mappings, map the root of this repository to `/var/www/html` - that's not true, but the file is copied there anyway.

This is a lot easier if you have already configured tests (see above), otherwise you may run into problems with PHPStorm looking for the PHP interpreter elsewhere.

It's also easier if you want to run PHP_CodeSniffer outside the container.  
Make sure you have a php executable in your path: as long as it is compatible with PHP_CodeSniffer it should be good, linting does not depend on PHP version or other software installed inside the containers.  
Then you just need to do `composer install` and `composer lint`, PHP_CodeSniffer detects the configuration file automatically. `composer lintfix` also works.

### Production

#### Make targets

There is a production-specific build target (`make cache`) that builds the php cache.

Make a git clone of this repo, then:

```bash
cp config/config-example.php config/config.php
nano config/config.php # Set the actual values
bin/build-cache
composer install --no-dev --classmap-authoritative --optimize-autoloader
```

If this is the first deployment you'll need to import `sql/database.sql`, `sql/database-data.sql` and `sql/database-procedures.sql` manually in the production database, if it is an update you may need to run the update script: use `php bin/update-db` on the server.

## More details

### Examples

There's a set of default items and products that can be used for tests.  
You get that by running `make examples`. It will reset the database, deleting any items or products that you added.  
There's not much more to it.

### Database

Database files are found in the `sql` directory.
- `database.sql`: schema. 
- `database-data.sql`: "static" data needed for the software to work. It can be edited, but you'll need to run `make features` afterwards.
- `database-procedures.sql`: some procedures and triggers, all of these are needed for the entire thing to work. 

### Feature list generation

`generate-features /path/to/this/directory` reads the feature list from `sql/database-data.sql`, converts it to PHP data structures and places it into `src/Database/Feature.php` and some other files (`generate-features` tells you which ones when it's finished).

The prefererred way to run this script is to use `make features` instead of calling it directly. This is a CLI script, you shouldn't upload it to a server or access it from the browser.

Modified files should be manually reviewed and committed.

### Router cache

To enable FastRoute cache, set `CACHE_ENABLED` to true in `config.php`.

Caching probably won't work in developement, so you could enable it only in `config-production.php` (which `make` copies to `build/config/config.php`).

Cache files in `build` directory are generated automatically when running `make`.
